# Terraform: VM Lab Environment

This template will create a hub-spoke environment for lab purposes.

The environment deployed contains the following resources:
- A network
    - NSG configured on the main subnet allowing access to ports 22 and 80
- n amount of VMs with an admin called "vmadmin" (Linux - ubuntu or centos)
    - Private key is generated by Terraform and stored in .terraform/.ssh/id_rsa

## Prerequisites

Prior to deployment you need the following:
* [azcli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
* [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) - 0.12

In Azure, you also need:
* A user account or service policy with Contributor level access to the target subscription

## Variables

These are the variables used along with their defaults. For any without a value in default, the value must be filled in unless otherwise sateted otherwise the deployment will encounter failures.

**Global Variables**

|Variable|Description|Default Value|
|-|-|-|
|tenant_id|The tenant id of this deployment|`null`|
|subscription_id|The subscription id of this deployment|`null`|
|client_id|The client id used to authenticate to Azure|`null`|
|client_secret|The client secret used to authenticate to Azure|`null`|
|location|The location of this deployment|`"UK South"`|
|resource_group_name|The name of an existing resource group - this will override the creation of a new resource group|`""`|
|resource_prefix|A prefix for the name of the resource, used to generate the resource names|`"vmlab"`|
|tags|Tags given to the resources created by this template|`{}`|

**Resource-Specific Variables**

|Variable|Description|Default Value|
|-|-|-|
|vnet_prefix|CIDR prefix for the VNet|`"10.100.0.0/24"`|
|vm_public_access|Flag used to enable public access to spoke VMs|`false`|
|vm_os|VM Operating system (Linux - ubuntu or centos)|`"ubuntu"`|
|vm_size|VM Size for the VMs|`"Standard_B1s"`|
|vm_disk_type|VM disk type for the VMs|`"Standard_LRS"`|
|vm_disk_size|VM disk size for the VMs in GB (Minimum 30)|`30`|
|vm_custom_data_file|Custom data file to be passed to the created VMs|`""`|
|vm_count|Number of VMs to deploy|`1`|

## Outputs

This template will output the following information:

|Output|Description|
|-|-|
|resource_group_name|Resource group of the VMs|
|vm_ids|List of VM Resource IDs|
|vm_names|List of VM names|
|vm_identity_principal_ids|List of VM Identity Principal IDs|
|admin_username|Username of the VM Admin|
|admin_private_key|Private key data for the vm admin|

## Deployment

Below describes the steps to deploy this template.

1. Set variables for the deployment
    * Terraform has a number of ways to set variables. See [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#assigning-values-to-root-module-variables) for more information.
2. Log into Azure with `az login` and set your subscription with `az account set --subscription='<REPLACE_WITH_SUBSCRIPTION_ID_OR_NAME>'`
    * Terraform has a number of ways to authenticate. See [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/guides/azure_cli.html) for more information.
3. Initialise Terraform with `terraform init`
    * By default, state is stored locally. State can be stored in different backends. See [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/index.html) for more information.
4. Set the workspace with `terraform workspace select <REPLACE_WITH_ENVIRONMENT>`
    * If the workspace does not exist, use `terraform workspace new <REPLACE_WITH_ENVIRONMENT>`
5. Generate a plan with `terraform plan -out tf.plan`
6. If the plan passes, apply it with `terraform apply tf.plan`

In the event the deployment needs to be destroyed, you can run `terraform destroy` in place of steps 5 and 6.

## Post-Deployment

To get access to the VM, you can use the `terraform output admin_private_key` command to retrieve the private key and using that SSH into the VM.
